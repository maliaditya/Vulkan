### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the necessary software and libraries installed for graphics programming. This includes:

- **Vulkan SDK**
- **GLFW**
- **GLM**
- **Microsoft Visual Studio** (or your preferred C++ compiler and IDE)

For detailed instructions, refer to [Prerequisites](https://maliaditya.github.io/Vulkan/00-Prerequisites).

### Setup

In this step, you’ll configure the project directory, download and organize libraries, and set up the build environment. The folder structure is outlined to help maintain a clean, modular project organization.

Follow the steps in [Setup](https://maliaditya.github.io/Vulkan/01-Setup) for detailed setup instructions.

### Creating an Empty Window

This section guides you through creating a basic application window using GLFW and Vulkan. It’s designed to help verify that your environment is set up correctly and that dependencies are linked properly.

Instructions are available in [Creating an Empty Window](https://maliaditya.github.io/Vulkan/02-Empty%20Window).

### Building the Project

Once the setup and code files are in place, follow these steps to compile and run your application. This section includes build configurations and commands to get the application running successfully.

Refer to [Building the Project](https://maliaditya.github.io/Vulkan/03-Build) for build instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Follow each section in the given order, starting from **Prerequisites** to ensure all required libraries and tools are in place.
2. Use **Setup** to organize your project and libraries.
3. Implement the **Empty Window** code to verify the setup.
4. Compile and test the application in **Build**.
